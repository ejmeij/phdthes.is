It's done
It's done... The public defense has taken place and all went well. If you're interested (or curious if you're on there as well!), the pictures of the event can be found <a href="http://phdthes.is/photos.php">here</a>. I've also updated the site to include links to the official UvA PhD thesis repository, where you can read individual chapters in PDF format. Now it's time for some well-earnt holidays :-). See you soon!
